This website is a personal project for the purpose of demonstrating my CSS and web design skills. All product images, brand names, logos, and trademarks used in this website belong to their respective owners, Balenciaga. This project is not commercial, and no infringement is intended. The use of these assets is for educational purposes only to showcase the design capabilities and is not meant to imply endorsement by or affiliation with Balenciaga.

In my endeavor to closely replicate the design using only HTML and CSS, I will be omitting certain accessibility features to achieve an accurate visual mimicry of the original layout. This decision is solely for the purpose of demonstrating specific design replication capabilities and does not reflect best practices in web development, where accessibility is paramount.
